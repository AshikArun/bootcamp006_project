I went from your average American 30-year-old, active lifestyle person, to a bedridden sick individual in need of a pacemaker. My heart would suddenly stop beating for seconds at a time, then like an old car suddenly start-up and begin to beat again. I was afraid to go to sleep for fear that I would not wake up in the morning, but after 30 hours, I couldn't stay up any longer. I said a very sincere prayer to God and I went to sleep. The turning point was that night in my hospital bed, the nurse poked me to see if I was still alive. The heart monitor went off and for a while, she was not able to get a reading. She nearly screamed out loud when I woke up and said \"hi\" from behind my oxygen mask. The next day, I was scheduled for a sonogram for my heart. I was weary and squeamish, and very scared. The technician urged me to look at my heart. I resisted. He urged once more, and said; \"I have seen a lot of bad hearts in my life, and your's is not one of them. Look at it, it is beautiful.\u201d", "Little did he know those words would change my life forever. I did look at the monitor that day. I marveled at the wonder on the screen. That amazing little muscle that kept my body alive. I wanted to be here, to be alive and live more fully. As a freelance worker at the time, I didn't have health insurance so I was asked to leave the hospital; I complied. My troubles stayed with me for about a month. I turned to yoga, juicing and holistic lifestyle.\u00a0 I continued to run and exercise and I stopped doing all recreational forms of drinking and socializing. And just as soon as the malaise had come, one day it went away. My heart, and my heartbeat that I had my entire life returned to me. My doctors, in particular, my cardiologists, were amazed. The doctor told me that whatever, I was doing to keep doing it and to go and enjoy life. He told me, not to return to his office again, I never did. And I never got a pacemaker.", "My love, passion, and gift for yoga was born as a result of the life opposing challenge of my troubled heart. Yoga held me together, rebuilt me emotionally, physically and grounded my health in ways that I could never have imagined.\u00a0 I continued my interest in yoga and became certified in Hatha, then in an Iyengar based form, then kriya, and mindfulness. I also became a certified Health Coach as well. All in an effort to help others. At my yoga classes, people would often come up afterward with riveting stories of emotional strife, physical disability, and even terminal disease. I started teaching adults with autism, foster youth and juvenile offenders. It was in this space that the potential impact and scope of teaching came to me. Yoga literally saved my life and could save others too!", "America is in so much pain, right now. We are on the brink of yet another war, aka \u2018skirmish\u2019 abroad.

I observed in my Life Force development program where I taught principles of mindfulness, yoga and provided life coaching for young males that they made a complete 360. They developed a sense of self-worth purpose and direction. This was the anti-cancer medicine that society had been waiting for. But the 3 and 8 weeks program span was not enough.

As the saying goes, \u201c", "\u201d With no village to support us my mother, brother, and I were left alone to navigate our grief and the complexities of the world.", "If we\u2019d had the container of community many things would have been different. If there had been other adults to mentor me, help me reflect on my experiences and understand what they were teaching me, and aid me in identifying and pursuing my passions, I would have discovered my path and purpose sooner and with more ease. I grew up feeling that I had to do everything by myself since there was no community to hold me as I went through life\u2019s transitions and challenges.", "Fortunately, I had access to nature, which became my refuge and source of nourishment. When I was outside under the sky and surrounded by plants, wild creatures, and mountains everything felt right. Nature was the place I went to for solace and inspiration, and that connection carried me through many difficult times. My love of the natural world rooted in my being and I grew up to become an herbalist and wilderness guide. ", "Wanting to see the magic and beauty of people\u2019s deeply connected experiences in the wilderness take root and blossom in their lives, I searched for everyday routines to nourish our relationship with the natural world. In my seeking I discovered deep nature-connection mentoring. ", "This model, also called\u00a0", ",\u00a0is what our staff is trained in and is a tool kit for building relationship with the people in our lives and the world of nature right outside our door. Using this model of mentoring, it quickly became clear to me that nature-connection mentoring provides\u00a0an ideal foundation in children, and with their families, to support the kind of immersive wilderness experiences young people need to mark their transition into adolescence. From this awareness, Feet on the Earth and a dream was born. ", "Children need mentoring and community beyond just their immediate family and at Feet on the Earth we endeavor to provide this mentoring and create that community. Week after week I watch the mentors pour their hearts and souls into the children they work with, striving to give each one what they need. For us mentoring youth in nature-connection is more than the teaching of physical skills. While technical skills such as primitive fire making, plant identification and usage, wildlife tracking, and shelter building are some of the most cherished things we teach, they comprise only half of the picture.", "At Feet on the Earth the physical skills are introduced within the context of exploring the full extent of what it means to belong to the natural world and a caring community of peers, mentors, parents and elders. There is extensive research demonstrating that nature and mentoring powerfully facilitate growth and learning and we see that these activities need to be planted in children within the container of community in order to nurture and sustain them. As a staff we spend hours planning, debriefing, trying to figure out how to support the child who is struggling, and celebrating the one who achieved a success this week.", "We sit on the cusp of Feet on the Earth blossoming into what I dreamed it could be \u2014 a nature-based community that has the depth of relationship needed to provide meaningful rites of passage to youth. After nine years of building relationship with the land and our community in Boulder County, we are taking the next step towards making this dream come true by starting to integrate rites of passage fully into our curriculum. ", " ", "This year, we offered the opportunity to participate in the first year of a multi-year rites of passage process to the youth in our weekly homeschool program who were ready to meet bigger challenges. Four youth and their families stepped in to participate this year and set their intentions at a Commencement Ceremony in March. We are meeting with the youth weekly and their parents once a month in preparation for a 5-day wilderness immersion that the youth will embark on in July.", "One of the youth participating in this year\u2019s rites of passage is 13 years old and has been part of our programs and community since he was 8. Over the past 5 years we\u2019ve watched him grow up and have built relationships with him and his parents that allow them to trust us to guide them through the vulnerable process of a child moving out of childhood, into adolescence and towards adulthood. To be witness to and in support of a process like this is truly a blessing. ", "At Feet on the Earth we are creating a new model that weaves long-term nature connection mentoring together with wilderness rites of passage, so that the rites of passage ceremonies we provide for children will be facilitated by the mentors they have grown up with, and are held by the community of people who know and love them. ", "Already over 70 hours of mostly volunteer staff time have been devoted to developing this year\u2019s rites of passage pilot program and another 400+ hours will be invested before it reaches its culmination in August. With the staff time and other expenses such as food, materials, and insurance, the actual cost of developing and running the program is about $8,000 but we are asking only for a nominal contribution $500/family since it is a pilot program and we want to ensure that this work is accessible to the families participating. Raising the $6,000 difference allows us to compensate staff for the hours they are putting into developing the curriculum and facilitating the three months of preparatory work taking place with the youth and their parents. ", "Raising an additional $8,000 to reach our campaign goal of $14,000 provides us the opportunity to devote over 500 staff hours in the coming year to integrating rites of passage fully into our nature-connection and community-building curriculum. Our aim is to sequence the curriculum so that each skill is delivered with timing that supports mastering of key developmental tasks at each stage of a child\u2019s life. ", "These are lofty goals and the reality is that the money our staff earn is paltry compared to how BIG their hearts are, how much they care about the children, and how dedicated they are to creating a better world for the future generations. I watch the mentors give so much while at the same time struggling to fix their cars, afford healthcare, and stay focused on the work that matters most to them while piecing together low-paying part-time jobs, so they can continue working for Feet on the Earth, which currently can offer them only part-time, seasonal work.", "\u00a0Last year, following my guidance, our board of directors voted to give all of the part-time staff a 10% raise and put them on payroll instead of continuing to hire them as independent contractors. As an organization we took on social security and Medicare matching, unemployment insurance, and an increase in workers compensation insurance cost to make this change. We also invested in more paid planning time for staff so that we could create the best experiences possible for the children, all while keeping our staff to participant ratios 1:6 and often as high as 1:3 to provide most personalized, hands-on learning for the children.", "There is no doubt that making these changes was the right thing to do, but we tried to do too much too fast and for the first time in our 9 year history (4+ years as my sole-proprietorship and almost 5 years as a non-profit) we are looking at a budget deficit. We need to raise at least $15,000 to meet our budget for the year or we will find ourselves in June or July unable to pay our bills, make payroll, and continue our work. I take responsibility for not reviewing the numbers more carefully and have learned so much from this experience. As an organization we have done an internal assessment and are creating a plan for how to go forward in a more sustainable way to ensure that we don\u2019t end up in this situation again.", "We recognize that we have to do fundraising and more marketing to support this vital work. Do we expect to do all of that with one crowd funding campaign? No. We are reaching out to individual donors, personally and through this campaign, seeking support from the business community, and applying to foundations for grants as part of our long-term fundraising strategy.", "The past five months have been an incredible journey for me, testing over and over my commitment to the vision I have for what I want to bring to the world. At times I\u2019ve felt tremendously afraid, wondering how we were going to stay afloat. There have been days when I wanted to give up, but the support of the dedicated people around me, the smiles and laughter of the children, the beauty of the Earth, and the longing in my own heart have urged me to keep going. Since we began on this journey what I\u2019ve learned most is how much people care about what we are doing at Feet on the Earth.", "While Feet on the Earth is the culmination of my life\u2019s work and journey so far, it is clear that Feet on the Earth has grown into something bigger than just my offering of love and gratitude to the world. It has taken root and become a place where others can show up to be of service to an eco-centric community, and a home where our collective dreams and vision for a sustainable future can grow and blossom.", "Like a bright faced youth coming of age, Feet on the Earth is ready to blossom from a growing, jumping, running, giggling child into a self-possessed, full-hearted, giving, nurturing, flowering presence of the community. It is with full hearts that we humbly ask you to stand as supporters and witnesses of this initiatory moment for Feet on the Earth.

However, there is no cure for Jina's disease, and the only way for her to get better is to have a heart transplant.", "The original organ transplant law in Japan did not allow patients younger than 15 to become organ donors, making it impossible for small children to have heart transplants in Japan. The law was revised in July 2009 to remove the age limit of the donor and enable organs to be harvested with the consent of the family. The health ministry had even revised the criteria for heart transplants, giving priority to recipients under 18.", "While it was a move long hoped for by families of children requiring heart transplants, who previously had to look overseas for donations, the harvesting of organs from children continues to face a number of challenges, including the emotional aversion of grieving parents, as well as inadequate procedures to confirm whether potential donors were victims of child abuse.", "I am running this marathon in an attempt to spread the word around Japan the importance of organ donation for children, and to encourage the Japanese public to register as donors, so that kids like Jina no longer have to look overseas for donations, and to give hope to these brave children.", "Running this marathon is just a small way to show support for my niece and young children around Japan who are waiting for that perfect gift.

I have wanted to be a teacher since I was eleven years old and have been pursuing that dream ever since. I am extremely passionate about the education of young children, and as a future teacher I am hyper-aware of the challenges many of our state school systems here in Massachusetts face in inspiring and teaching their students in a way that is both effective and meaningful. ", "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Growing up in a very privileged town and attending some of the top schools in the state, I have always felt a strong need to give back to the local education systems that are struggling both financially and educationally. As a result, this summer I have decided to take it upon myself to raise $5,000 worth of brand new school supplies for a select public elementary school that desperately needs the help. ", "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 After contacting the Superintendent of Boston Public Schools, I was directed to the", ". I spoke with the Assistant Principal of the school and expressed my intentions of funding a large donation of brand new school supplies for the upcoming school year (starting in Fall of 2016). To say he was thankful was an understatement. Within a few days I got in my car and drove into Dorchester to visit the Paul A. Dever Elementary School. I instantly fell in love with the school, staff, and students. After such a powerful and eye-opening experience, I will do everything I can to meet the goals of my fundraiser for them, and this is why:", " - All public schools in the state are rated on a scale from 1-5, with a rating of 5 being the worst.

Dever School is ", "of", " level 5 schools in the State of Massachusetts.", " - A level 5 school means that the school is chronically underperforming without showing signs of substantial improvement over time and is therefore in danger of being shut down by the state. To put it in perspective, a level 3 school warrants immediate attention, funding, and resources from the State and is considered \"at risk\".", " - 100% of the students receive free or reduced breakfast and lunch.", "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As I walked through the hallways of the school, it was impossible to ignore the bleak classrooms with barren walls and empty shelves. The school has no room in its state budget to purchase any decorations for the hallways or classrooms, and therefore the walls are mostly empty with a few washed out bulletin boards and the occasional hand-made poster. I found it shocking to hear that for each student to receive a pencil box on the first day of school filled with crayons, pencils, a glue stick, a calculator, and a ruler would be considered a luxury. The school simply cannot afford to provide basic school supplies to their students such as paper, notebooks, pencils, markers, calculators, rulers, stickers, binders, glue sticks, scissors, tape, etc. ", "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After meeting with the gym teacher I learned (and saw for myself) that the school did not have any gym or recess equipment for the students.
