I deleted following columns/fields from original dataset to narrow down the set I have to work with for this project:
	- Area
	- Perimeter
	- Cancerp020
	- State_Fips
	- *_lb
	- *_ub
	- *_lbuus
	- *_lusub
	- *_sp

I deleted the following duplicate rows:
	- anything where STATE + NCI UNIT (County Name) + NCI FIPS Code are the same, I delete all duplicate rows
	- only affected Alaska as it had several exact rows in place

Total Rows After Cleaning = 3055

    Abstract:  
      This data set contains 1970-1994 cancer mortality information for counties 
      in the United States.  Included are death rates, number of deaths, 
      confidence levels, and expected number of deaths for white males and white 
      females for 20 cancers.  The data are from a cancer mapping project in the 
      National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and 
      Genetics (DCEG).

        the NCI reporting unit.

        Cancer Institute.  For most of the data the reporting units are 
        counties.  In Montana, New York, and Wisconsin some counties were 
        combined to create the NCI reporting unit.  In Virginia independent 
        cities were combined with the surrounding counties to create the NCI
        reporting unit.  Data for Alaska and Hawaii were available at the State 
        level only.  Alaska and Hawaii were coded as 02999 and 15999, 
        respectively, and were considered as counties in the maps.

      Attribute_Definition: 
        This field was used to create the maps in the National Atlas of the 
        United States and the Atlas of Cancer Mortality in the United States: 
        1950-94.  It is the death rate excluding areas considered unstable by 
        the National Cancer Institute.  The rates are for cancer XXX (see table 
        below) per 100,000 population for gender Y (see table below).  The 
        numbers are age-adjusted to the 1970 U.S. population.  An area was 
        considered unstable if (a) the observed number of deaths was less than 
        6; (b) the observed number of deaths was less than 12 and the rate was 
        not significantly different statistically from the U.S. rate; or (c) the 
        expected number of deaths was less than 6 and the rate was not 
        significantly different statistically from the U.S. rate.
